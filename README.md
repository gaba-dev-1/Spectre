## üó∫Ô∏è Core Components

### Augmented Reality Navigation
Advanced AR systems for flood navigation:
- **Real-time flood mapping** - Live 3D visualization of water levels and currents
- **AR waypoint system** - Virtual markers guiding safe passage routes
- **Hazard detection** - AI-powered identification of dangers in flooded terrain
- **Multi-modal guidance** - Visual, audio, and haptic navigation feedback

### Homeric Navigation Algorithms
Navigation wisdom from the Odyssey:
- **Stellar navigation** - Using stars and celestial bodies for direction finding
- **Current reading** - Understanding water flow patterns like ancient mariners
- **Weather prediction** - Traditional signs for forecasting storms and conditions
- **Island hopping strategy** - Optimal routes between safe havens

### Journey Management System
Complete voyage planning and execution:
- **Multi-stage route planning** - Breaking long journeys into manageable segments
- **Resource consumption modeling** - Calculating food, water, and fuel needs
- **Companion coordination** - Managing group travel and communication
- **Emergency contingencies** - Backup plans for when primary routes fail

## üèõÔ∏è Mythological Foundation

**Odysseus's Navigation Wisdom**: The hero's ten-year journey home provides timeless lessons in navigation, perseverance, and adaptation to changing conditions.

**Polaris and Constellation Navigation**: Ancient Greek methods of stellar navigation adapted for modern AR interfaces, providing backup navigation when GPS fails.

**The Cyclical Journey**: Understanding that survival is not just reaching safety, but the complete cycle of departure, trial, and return that builds wisdom and community.

**Divine Guidance**: Translating the concept of divine intervention into AI-assisted decision making and pattern recognition.
